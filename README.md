COMP 488: Machine Learning
==============================
#### Computer Science Department
#### Loyola University Chicago
### Instructor
* Dr. Dmitriy (Dima) Dligach

## Course Objectives

Machine learning is the process of making predictions and decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. Topics include a variety of supervised learning methods. Ensemble approaches are used to combine independent models efficiently. Unsupervised and semi-supervised methods demonstrate the power of learning from data without an explicit training goal.
