#### Objectives

Machine learning is the process of making predictions and decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. Topics include a variety of supervised learning methods. Ensemble approaches are used to combine independent models efficiently. Unsupervised and semi-supervised methods demonstrate the power of learning from data without an explicit training goal.
