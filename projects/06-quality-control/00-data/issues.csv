05b5dy45patbp5qv|The screen kept freezing and the controller is hard to operate. I kept getting a message that my network was slow though I never have problems with my DSL speed. There were many brands and types of products to choose from.  The layout of the shelves was very organized and made for a fun shopping trip.  The bright yellow packaging made it easy to find on the shelf. The controller kept freezing up on me so it took me a long time to actually be able to pick it up.|2.0|2

07jjm2dajj5658zb|It took me a little bit to figure out how to use the controls. It was very well organized and had all the different brands placed separately from each other, instead of a lot of stores that I've shopped at for these particular products, usually have the brands all mixed together and organized by their strength instead of their brand.  Because I have bought that item before and it sticks out due to the color of it being a bright blue. So all I had to do was find the correct SPF 50, and that was easy because as I answered in one of my previous comments, all the brands are well organized.|1.0|1

Not only easily located, but with an array of options within those brands. I wasn't forced into choosing a different brand because of lack of product. The display was exceptionally neat and I had the urge to look around because there was so much more to meet the eye. I ended up choosing two bottles each of what I actually needed because I couldn't decide which I liked better.  It was located on the top shelf in plain sight.

Just double click to place in shopping basket.  Just grab it and put it back if not the right one. shelves were full.  Choices were grouped nicely from what  I could tell.  My vision is not excellent and I am too short to see upward or reach top shelves so I would have trouble seeing everything displayed and also would be unable to   reach those up high.

I knew that the product came in a royal blue bottle, so I knew to look for things in that color family before the exercise started.

If you're going to do this in the store.  Have training sessions in the store for older customers or you will be alienating a large segment of the market who could really utilize this type of shopping on a daily basis.

It seemed as if there were many unavailable products in the aisles. When I was instructed to choose a specific item it was much easier, but I was shown a depiction rather than an actual product. The only problem with online shopping is that I cannot pick the exact product I would like, except the brand and size. I like to inspect the product for quality, which is the reason I chose Butterball instead of the generic brand as I cannot see the color of the product to ensure freshness. I saw what seemed to be a generic brand of turkey in the virtual store, and clicked on it to view details, but since I do not know the quality of the product and it was the same price or more expensive than the Butterball brand, I decided not to purchase it. 1.0 It was directly in view.

The fresh frozen turkey compared with the frozen premium turkey by Butterball. There was another turkey packaged in a blue wrapper, but I could not see its name. Also the turkey's that came in a bag and could go direct to the oven from the freezer. These were new kinds of choices of turkey for me. 1.0 Because I had browsed through all the types of turkey products that were available in the showcase.

I didn't notice it till you had me pick out the 22 pound house brand.    I suggest that when you place the hand over  an item a pop-up balloon with that info happen immediately. It will speed up browsing I think. Rather than clicking pulling up reading the info bar and maybe putting it back.     Leave the info bar....but the balloon would be a good enhancement.    BTW ....kudo's for adding the joy stick vs arrow keys as before.....MUCH easier to navigate around. I honestly only noted there were house brands and others besides butterballs. Since I was unfamiliar with the other/new ones I went with Butterball.  It had a very distinctive packaging Blue vs reds yellows and browns. Also....the entire freezer was laid out so each grouping was distinctive.  Light colored (yellow whites) separted by a red grouping then a light color and then blue.  So each manufacturer was clear and distinct by grouping.  Further they were just not 'piled up' in the bin.|0.0|0

I'm unsure if that was a glitch or if that virtual experience exercise wanted me to stay in that one area of the store. I believe the product brand I noticed in the virtual store that I haven't seen in my grocery store was the Jenny-O whole turkey. I've heard of the Jenny-O brand, but I believe it was for a different product. 2.0 Honestly, it was easy to find because when I was put in the virtual store, it was literally right in front of me.

Well, we do try and eat healthier, but sometimes I view it as I lived for nearly 60 yrs eating Butterball turkey as they have always been raised and have had no health issues. That $20 I would put toward getting the supplies for the rest of the holiday meals. Some folks are rich...let them buy the much higher priced special turkeys.  I am very familiar with the packaging. Oh, BTW, I chose to buy 2 turkeys at the same time since there were 2 available in the size I wanted for both Thanksgiving & Christmas. Usually I can't do that at our stores locally because they are picked over....HTH. Thanks for a relevant, fun survey! :)|0.0|0

The navigation can be very frustrating because it comes nowhere close to being accurate. I WOULD MUCH RATHER SHOP IN A REGULAR PHYSICAL GROCERY STORE...PERIOD!   The navigation on this exercise is very ridiculous. Does not respond quickly. Some of the arrows take you to absurd places, like the ceiling. Some zoom you through an area when you would like to proceed slowly.

There should also be a version for people with tablets, phones, and touch-screen computers so you can use your fingers to move in and out and turn, pick, ect. That would be fun!  I recently had to change my diet to AIP (autoimmune paleo) which means I am not allowed to have gluten, wheat, soy, corn, or dairy. I found out I have Hashimoto's Hypothyroidism, and diet greatly affects me. I wish there were more healthy options..more REAL whole foods without these things added. Our culture and society is simply not this way. The prices for the right things for me are high, and it is VERY hard to find things that agree with my diet. I would love it if there were more option and delicious options at that. Food is to sustain us and support our bodies, but it is also for enjoyment. I don't want to be miserable everytime I eat, and I also don't want to cave into foods that will make my health worse. I'm also a single mother of two. I can't afford most of the food I need and I can't afford to be so sick, foggy-brained and in pain all the time either. Larger companies must invest time, energy, and money into their local surrounding farms, etsy food-makers, ANYBODY producing goods that will be good for everybody. Why? Stimulate the economy, and give health to those who can't afford it. I'm saddened by the fact that huge coorperations that HAVE the means choose not to make better decisions. They might be  more complicated  and require more  ins-and-outs , but since when did everything have to be so easy? Stop worrying so much about rules and regulations and create the ideas..every great and inspired idea works out and benefits humanity when people stop looking for reasons it won't, and starting MAKING it work. I'm rambling, and possibly not explaining my point as well as I would have before my Hashimoto's hypothyroidism and whatever other underlying disease I may or may not have as well. Just another reason why I desperately need my food choices to be easier, readily available, cheaper, and taste good..although the last one is the least significant when it comes down to it.

It takes extra, unnecessary time to master, and makes navigating even the most well-designed aisles incredibly frustrating. The products were grouped by brand just like I expected them to be.

r8s57vjn14dve96k|The forward arrow made the sight line move up to the lights on the ceiling It seemed to get stuck up there. It would not let you go to another isle and getting back to the correct isle was very hard.  Another problem was that the hand wouldn't grab the item and I had to do it several times. The sign said to move forward more but it was already as far forward as it would go. This took up a lot of time and made it very hard to finish the shopping. I ran out of time twice before I could finish it. I liked that all the snack / meal supplement bars were located on one side of the whole isle. There were many more than I see in my grocery store. I was looking for one brand in particular and was surprised in the many varieties of that brand that I had not seen before. I never knew that nature Valley had so many choices. The rest I bought were fruit inside and variety packs I had not seen before. Special K is my husbands favorite cereal and that is why I bought those bars. I like that the cereal isle is just across from the other isle.  Because all the special K bars are together in one area so it was easy to find. the hardest part is that the virtual store didn't work like it should and the cart was not visible and I had to change the page size to add it.

s218501aexfvy3aw|I should have waited til this question to answer what I did in the previous one, because I have pretty much already answered this, sorry. It was all my computer's fault, I assume, although it usually doesn't have problems with games or interactive websites, etc., but it did with this one. It lagged badly making it very hard to move where I wanted to. I would have to switch between full screen and not full screen repeatedly. And whenever I made an adjustment with the joystick, it would do nothing until I moved my cursor outside of the interactive window. So I had to click on the navigator and then swipe my cursor to the outside corner of my screen just to get it to acknowledge my movements. Everything was fully stocked and efficiently arranged and orderly. The number of different items was almost overwhelming, but it wasn't too many to be able to appreciate it and to be able to find something good.  My computer seems to not be able to handle the 3d experience that well. It's lagging badly, so it was a real chore to movearound in it. I was was up too close to the shelf and couldn't move back. I would move one way and when it didn't move, I would move further, then it would catch up with my first move and do them both, so it would move a lot further than I meant it to. It was difficult. But that's not what we're evaluating, I know. The aisle arrangement itself was easier to navigate! True, there were a lot of products, many of which are very similar in design, so it was not that quick to find the right one, but it was not a problem.|1.5|2

It was also a little strange that you would require closing and re-opening the virtual store during the survey considering how many times the loading time is mentioned.  Maybe the questions in the middle of the survey would be better on another pop up or something to prevent the extra loading time.

fam4sxbrcz8azqrk|Only one, and I probably just didn't see it.  I was wanting to find a good named brand pizza that was  chicken alfredo.  I couldn't find it, so maybe there isn't one yet on the shelf.  I have had it through a pizza parlour and wanted to find it on the shelf to take home and eat when I want. Everything made sense as I walked about, because each section was complete with all offerings of that type.  Everything flowed in a way that I would have expected, so I could create my meals.  Each section had so many choices of every type of food and made in every different way imaginable.  Very neatly organized, I believe I spent about 50.00 more than usual due to finding new foods to try from brands I had not seen on the shelf.  These shelves were stocked full, making it easier to find what I wanted.  Our Kroger seems to have too many empty spots, especially in the dessert section, making it so hard to find what you want and wasting time.  Hopefully they will set their frozen food section up like this study has it.  Also, I really liked the frozen food cases.  So much nicer than the ones in our Kroger.  It was so appealing and I spent a great deal of time in all aisles because it was easy on the eye with all of those nice cases that didn't have stickers and signs all over the glass fronts.  Those make it so hard to see products.  I could see all of these frozen food items with clarity.  Good and clear sign stating breakfast items.

n37by1wvv17us9vs|I know this is a virtual reality scenario, but it really is an extra hassle to have to open the cooler doors. Can't we have the products visually in the same scenario without the hassle of the cooler door, I understand the appeal of VR because its life like, but can't we just have the coolers where we can reach right in and look and the product? It would save such a hassle because you have to learn to maneuver around the door after you open it. Extra time and effort, and isn't that the point of this technology to save us time and effort with a life like experience? Yes I was able to learn better ways to get around the door after playing with it for a bit, but honestly if I have to go through that much hassle why not go to a physical store to do my shopping. Because part of the allure to customers for this program is going to be the ability to offer them something that is going to save them time or money, not just the shopping experience.

I like the way all the types were together, meaning that all the fish, was together, all the chicken was together, all the pizza and pizza products were together. The tub ice creams were together, all the novelties were together and the new items were clearly marked so it got your attention. All the single dinners were together, the multi-dinner meal starters were together. The organic meals were together. If the item was natural it was clearly marked. The cakes and pies and whipped toppings were all together. So what ever you needed be it fish or dessert, you just had to look for the section and you could find what you were looking for pretty easily. And there were arranged by brands so you could look for that as well.  It was somewhat easy to find once I found the breakfast items and the eggo waffles.

I know it's not the way a normal person would actually shop, but I was trying to grab something in an adjacent section while crouched and i kind of had to end my run a little early. Clear signage was very nice.  For example, I could easily see where the various meals or vegetable sections started without having to browse the actual shelves until I was in the right place.      Once there, it looked like many sections were sorted by brand, so it was easy to pick out a brand I know I like (BirdsEye SteamFresh veggies) and grab several of the offerings.  I was in the novelties section for way too long instead of the ice cream section.  It seemed more like a novelty item for some reason so I was looking near the ice cream bars instead of the actual ice cream.

I like all the choices. They seemed to be arranged well but it was a bit daunting with all the different varieties and brands.  Well, this time, it was very difficult to maneuver in the store. There was some sort of bin blocking the aisle where vegetarian stuff was. I thought at first, that I was blocked and not allowed on that aisle. I was finally able to go down the aisle as I was about to abandon the exercise from frustration, lol. Then, I find the products and could barely read any labels. I chose my selection by picture.

Then, there were the side dishes, such as the fries, curly fries, and onion rings. I saw the area for the frozen chicken. And, next to that, I was able to find the frozen seafood products adjacent to it. All the signs showed where I needed to look, and once I looked at the shelves, I noticed items that got me really curious, such as the Applebees and Arbys brand of products. I like this a lot, because they make good stuff. That is why we also eat at their restaurants.  I found it very difficult to navigate because my Internet connection is quite slow, according to the messages that I got. But, in real life, I have no problem finding out the products that my family eats. So, I am not at all concerned as to not being able to find the product at a fast rate on the video screen of the computer.

Those are both reasons why it took so long for me to find the product in the second shopping trip. I made a mistake in that I forgot the directions mentioned three aisles would be available, I think. I forgot and only shopped one aisle, which had frozen entrees on one side and frozen vegetables on the other. They were well arranged. A prompt during the exercise to explore other aisles would have been helpful.  I was looking for meat or burger products, then remembered that Morningstar Farms is a vegetarian product.|2.0|2

Well because I had just  walked  the aisles a minute ago and remembered where the vegetarian section was. I also knew that Morning Star is that type of company. When I approached the section I couldn't read the titles and had to click on the item to read it. I also wasn't remembering perfectly the item I was to choose.

Your application needs work.  I have no opinion on how your department was arranged. I could not use the navigation feature. It overshot the target area when I used the up-down-left-right arrows, and I was unable to select any products. Despite the fact that the introduction to the actual shopping experience indicated that I could pick anything on the virtual shelves, everything I clicked on had the red circle and slash on the icon.

1vzd4hq7d5gpejsz|I only have issues with navigating on the keyboard or with the mouse. I didn't like being timed for it. I did not like that you couldn't close the freezer door, you had to navigate around it, as if you couldn't close the door while in the physical store. In my Fred Meyer (kroger) store, you sometimes have obstacles. In the bread department and the cereal department, there are posts you might be able to move one cart around the left side, but people just bottleneck on the path to the right of it. Same with the cereal department. In one or two of the sections of the store-frozen pizza, for example, there is a big coke/sprite display that's four feet high. It was easier to shop in the virtual store because not only were there no people, there were no poles or displays obstructing the way. I liked it until I was looking for the Stouffer's chicken enchiladas. I saw the Kroger version on the bottom shelf, but I had to look up high up for the Souffer's version.Typically I find the Kroger version next to the Stouffer's version one time and bought the Kroger version, which was on sale. We weren't as pleased with the Kroger enchiladas, but my husband picked the box up thinking  hey, it's on sale! . I did like, in this example, that the Souffer's was with the Stouffers. I didn't like that I could no find the small packages of vegetables, though. We are a small family of 3, and we prefer the smaller packages. To me, this example was comparable to going shopping in a store in another part of the country (where's the Tillamook brand? What, no Dreyer's?). I was too engrossed in trying to find the product that i didn't notice the display and how it was arranged, other than there were no empty spots in the display.  It was pretty easy to find, except I am not adept with any of the methods to toggle up and down, left and right with the mouse or the keyboard keys.|2.0|2

2wyyffa4jtavumvz|It wasn't loading well on my computer so it was very choppy and the movement was too sensitive sometimes then not sensitive enough other times.  I didn't like the the natural/organic foods were just mixed in with the conventional foods. I typically shop for only natural/organic and the reason Kroger/Fred Meyer is the only non-natural foods store I shop in is because they usually have a special section specifically devoted to natural/organic foods. I don't like having to walk through every isle to find what I need, and I'm not very interested in the non-natural/non-organic products so I feel like it just wastes my time. I looked FOREVER to find the ice cream, then I couldn't remember what flavor I was supposed to find. I've never even heard of this brand of ice cream before so the packaging didn't stand out at all, and the Grand candy flavors were towards the bottom and not at eye level. You should put a reminder of what type of ice cream we're looking for in the survey. This was super hard and time consuming.|1.0|1

301gbw4q5qz0ee0w|There were too many rows which made me have to move up/down & zoom in/out a lot to make sure I didn't miss anything. Other than that, as I used the controls, I found it got easier to navigate. Most comparable products next to each other on the shelves. This made it easy to compare brands, prices, and sizes.  It belongs to the Breakfast category which I noticed on the signs in the aisles. Also, the box color/detail was easy to spot.|1.0|1
317aar960jk3k4sc|nothing I liked that it is easy to see what you want.  I also liked that the chicken, seafood, hand held meals, potatoes are in teh same area.  I couldn't see the writing on the icecream and took me longer than normal to find it.|1.0|1

It is similar to other stores i have shopped, so that makes sense to me. Some of the products were brand new to me, between things i normally would buy which made me more likely to see them. i like seeing the healthy versions of products like bread next to the regular versions.  i remembered what aisle the ice cream was on, and Edy's has a distinctive striped lid i would have found it much sooner, but the program froze on me.|1.0|1

3z3zsryq89hf2kpg|I had some trouble remembering that the left and right arrows on the keyboard panned right or left and did not step right or left. I found that confusing because the up and down arrows stepped you forward or backward. It seems like the left and right arrows not included on the joy stick should have panned. I liked the large signs indicating the types of food and their location. I also liked the aisle signs in between each aisle.  The aisles are clearly labeled and flowed in a way that made sense plus the aisle label with a few things listed among the aisle was clearly visible and had other items that would tell me ice cream should be there too. The ice cream was also sorted by brand which made edy's easier to spot.|1.0|1
3z7nwex7h8tq7kpz|The movement is touchy-- either too slow, or so fast I overcorrected a lot. I liked having all the edamame together, not separated by brand, so that I could find the one I wanted.

Plus, items were really out of focus unless you moved right up to the case door. That's not the same as when one is walking down an aisle. Usually items are in focus from a couple of feet away Seemed to be almost arranged by color of the vegetables  I misread the aisle sign for breakfast foods. I thought it was one aisle over when it was two. So I searched the wrong aisle and thought I was on the right track when I was looking at bread items.

8byy24nunqhynq8a|Initially, it is somewhat difficult to turn around, but once you have done so you can slide down the aisle.  However, I did not think about opening the door in the frozen section.  It was necessary to close the door after you opened it if you wanted to go back to the left.  In other words, sometimes the opened door gets in your way.  You can figure out how to navigate around it. It was arranged in such a way that you could be thorough in browsing a particular frozen food product -- for example, ice cream and novelties are side-by-side.  You can see everything that is available in that area.  In fact, that entire section is desserts which includes the ice creams, novelties and followed by frozen fruit at the end.  The multi-family entrees and single entrees are on one entire side of the aisle.  In other words, the arrangement makes sense.  It was located in the desserts area.  Working my way from the end of the aisle I found the different brands of ice cream.  There were several Edy's flavors together on the shelf. I picked up Rocky Road first, but found the Butterfinger Cup next.|1.0|1

However, any problems I had other than that I was unsure as to whether or not they were due to the virtual store or my computer. It was very easy to find items that would potentially be bought together because they were normally in the same aisle. For example, when my husband is getting his food for lunches he gets 2 or 3 single serve meals from usually different brands, as well as tator tots or french fries and chicken strips, and he usually likes to grab a box of the loaded potato skins when he gets the chance. The tator tots, french fries, potato skins, and single serve meals were all in the same aisle, and the chicken fingers were in the following aisle.

There weren't near as many brands as I'm used to seeing and the size options weren't there for the various vegetables I usually buy. There also weren't many vegetables other than the normal ones seen in America. I like shopping where I find different produce. The controls weren't acting like they should and it was very hard to see what the flavor of ice cream was on the shelf without picking it up.|2.0|2

Always makes the survey more fun and interesting. Also makes your experience much more real than just taking a plain survey. What I liked about how the department was arranged was that it was easy to find things. Also I noticed that the new products were at eye level to catch my attention. Which I like because sometimes when it's blended into the middle. You don't usually see them. Over all it was an easy flow and easy to find  some  of the products that I usually buy.  The reason why I feel that it was some what easy to find, is because I wasn't sure at first if I grabbed the right container.

I like to know where my products will be located, so I can get my shopping done efficiently.

This might not have been as difficult, if I were in person, instead of attempting this shopping trip virtually. I find virtual shopping a bit awkward. I found it okay, but could have found it much more quickly, if I were in the store with an actual cart, instead of trying to manipulate the virtual experience.|3.0|3

pb1twv30auwh3tkf|The world and controls are sluggish and when they do move they move suddenly. The products are near impossible to see unless you're right on top  of them and then you can't move because you have to, in fact, be right on top of them, and you run into a stupid virtual door that you can't get around and cannot easily close, so the only thing truly realistic is the damned doors being in the way (except, they don't close by themselves like it would at the store). Sadly, this took far longer for me to do than it would have to shop it at the store because the VR was so cumbersome.     I'm running a decent computer with top speed FIOS internet connection and I had nothing else running on my computer to bog it down.  It took so long to load the first time, that I got logged out due to  inactivity  and then had to go through the process of loading it again. If you're going to load a VR world that takes up to 10 minutes to load, you should probably extend the idle logout time to beyond 10 minutes.      And why allow the VR to open doors that lead to products that they can't pick up.    Additionally while it was in the practice demo, the ability to flip products over and look at ingredients was absent in the actual VR world. I was able to twist the item upside with the face still in front, but, why do I need to do that when it just fips the text upside down.  Without the ability to flip the product over, it potentially changed my decisions because I will sometimes buy a  better for you  product based on ingredients if the price tag is in budget for me, but I will not purchase things I don't know the ingredients in, so i picked up and purchased nothing in this shopping trip that isn't known to me, even though some of the things I picked were not necessarily  good for you , it's better the known  bad  than the unknown  bad .    The VR store had no issues that I saw. It was the VR experience that was the problem. It was logical, except I couldn't tell why the DiGiorno pizzas were separated. I'm guessing size, but I was unable to tell what the difference was in the virtual world.     Other than that, things were easy to find.  The store is laid out well. However, the virtual reality thing is a pain in the butt and is difficult to maneuver, so it really adds  on to the time it takes to get a product.|3.0|3

I could see the Breakfast sign above the aisle so I knew which aisle to go down, then I could see the breakfast sign above the frozen food case where they would be located.

I knew I was in the right aisle because of the big overhead signs stating I was in the breakfast aisle.

vmrgyxqduzwfjds6|The joystick was somewhat hard to maneuver, as sometimes I found myself going in circles. Or, if I want to go forward, it may move too fast or it would not park me to exactly where I wanted to land. Other than that, the items were grouped properly in sections where a customer can find it. I just did not explore  all  the frozen food aisles during the initial exercise. I thought I was suppose to go through the two aisles originally to do my shopping. Thanks. I liked how the frozen foods department was grouped in different categories (i.e.; pizzas in one section with same brands put next to each other so a specific brand would be easy to spot). I liked that signs were posted locating the frozen item by the door, making it faster and easier to find specific frozen items. The aisles were wide enough for shopping carts to move through. I noticed when entering the grocery store, the produce section is immediately noticeable. I presume the registers were at the right side of the entrance but were not visible. Usually I would see the registers very close to the entrance/exit doors. Just want to say the produce section was very appealing, which caught my eye for the manner they were presented. But this shopping trip for me was to explore the two sections of the frozen department. I liked that all the items were well stocked and very neatly arranged. Thank you.  When I originally took the virtual tour around the Kroger grocery store, I only went through two frozen aisles where much of the breakfast, frozen chicken, Asian, and pizza items were located. Those were the only frozen sections that I had gone through during the original exercise. During the next exercise where I was suppose to find a different item (Morning Star Farms Grizzlers), I was searching for it in the aisles I originally toured. I did not even think of searching at a  different  aisle of the store. That is where I found the Morning Star Farms item. If I had gone through different aisles, I probably would have found this item much faster. At first, I thought Kroger did not carry the item; but then, I thought it would not be right if the store did not carry it. I then thought this exercise was to test the customer that this item did not exist in the store. But, then I realize that perhaps it is in a different aisle--which turned out to be true. I know this exercise took me a long time to find it. Thanks.|1.0|1

I like how Frozen Chicken, Meat and Seafood are divided into each of their neat category.  I like how Pizza and international frozen are side by side with each other.

I liked that the healthier foods were more lumped together instead of some over here and some over there, and then all the snack or junkier type of foods were way on the other side. It would encourage me to stick to one of the frozen foods isles and not be tempted to wander over to the ice cream (for example) because I can get most of what I need in one place.  It was in the section labeled  Breakfast  and although all of the Eggo products were not in one location, all of the Egoo waffle products were.

The virtual store is one of the best ways to do a survey to give the tester a better way to understand everything you want from them. The signs above were large and well placed to make it easy to read for people who might have vision issues. The organization of the products matched to the product next to it so that you felt you were not jumping into something like vegetarian to pizza but you were instead moving into the lite options that still offer vegetarian products by different companies. This makes it easier to find products.  A prime burger should be at eye level. A spicy type should be below. Nuggets should be up high. Black bean should be next to the prime burgers. It was not hard to find just different.|0.0|0

Everything sweet was grouped together, from frozen fruit to cool whip to dessert cakes.  It tricked me a little bit, I thought it would be on the novelty side of the frozen aisle. It was with all of the regular ice cream. However, I knew exactly where to go to find it and once I looked on the other side of the aisle it was easy to spot.

This store did an excellent job of keeping items from the same brand together, and the flow from one kind of food to another was, in my opinion, was done with great care. Somebody really knew what they were doing.  I would have found it earlier if the interactive tool had cooperated.

But I genuinely have trouble operating the joystick in the virtual 3D experience of the store.  It would be easy if I did not have so much trouble with the joystick.

I already knew that MorningStar Burgers were vegetarian burgers, so I looked for the  Vegetarian  sign on the aisle markers then above the products.

Like objects were near each other (steamable veggie bags near frozen veggies, pizza rolls nearby the pizzas, etc), provided many options for most of the foods.

Also, I couldn't grab the Digornoes from the front freezer, so I went to the pizza aisle and just got a different pizza. It seemed very orderly and neat, as well as categorized. My preferences would probably be unreasonable, so it was overall a nice arrangement. It would be easier to have related meals closer to each other. Like, garlic bread close to frozen meatballs.  I knew where to look (which aisle), but I didn't know where it would be on that aisle; I'm assuming it must be alphabetical. I also saw the cookie dough flavored Edy's brand ice cream and assumed the Butterfinger would be on the same row as that, but it looked like it was with the chocolate up a row or two. I think the categories of the ice cream should be grouped together. Traditional like vanilla and chocolate together, and candy bar flavors maybe below that.|1.0|1

THank you for letting me participate in this survey today. I really do appreciate it. Thanks again. I liked how all the packages were arranged by brands. For example, all the Starbucks was in one section, all the Dunkin Donuts were in another section, the Eight O'Clock coffee in another section, the Archer Farms, Seattle's Best, Newman's Own, etc. Each brand had its own particular section on the shelf and that made it so much more easy to find what I was looking for. Thank you.  The way this shelf was organized made shopping and finding the products I was looking for so much easier. So I did prefer this design and layout much better. Thank you. I remembered seeing this brand on the shelf when I did the previous exercise where I went shopping for coffee pods and so I was able to quick find it again on the shelf, since it had not moved and it was in the same position as it was in the previous exercise. This was a fun exercise to do. Thank you.|1.0|1

It makes it easy for me to get the right size when I want it.  It has more variety in brands and sizes. It's a more complete selection than where I currently shop. Has more bigger sizes that in the long run would be cheaper, but also has small sizes to try out a new brand or get a brand that only one person likes. It was in the middle of the aisle and the Starbucks brand logo sticks out so well, so then it was just a matter of finding right variety and size.|0.0|0

gfz77sbcmbax2zbm|Moving around in the store is fairly easy, and picking up and examining packages is not hard, but it's just not the same (obviously) as holding it in your hand.  However, having taken several of these types of surveys, it does a pretty good job of giving a virtual experience. Brands/sizes were together, BUT pod-count might be a better arrangement style, i.e. all 9-count boxes together, all 22-count boxes together;  Brand names could be arranged vertically or horizontally  together as much as the pod-counts matched.  Layout by brand is good, layout by pod-count is also good.  The store I usually shop for coffee may change their shelf arrangement between trips, so you havfe to  re-learn  the arrangement.   Customers like routine; there's nothing more frustrating than finding your favorite product is not in the same place it's been for the last three months, and you have to search for it again. Packaging is so similar, I picked up Decaf first.  But, I'm not sure that's a packaging problem.|2.0|2

Makes shopping a whole lot easier since you can see the various sizes and flavors of each variety along with the pricing enabling decision making without any back and forth comparisons.

I think they were arranged alphabetically (by brand) for the regular coffees. The way the different brands were grouped together regardless of how many pods were in a box.  I shop for pods at Costco where the selection is quite minimal. Although I may try out a different brand for something special, I'm mainly a creature of habit and buy the Kirkland brand because they are so much less expensive - about 50 cents per pod as compared to over a dollar for some of these brands. I had to keep too many words in my head while looking at the boxes. It was easy to find the right brand, but then I had to look through many varieties and pod numbers.

They carry everything I want in whatever pod-count I want.  The only time I shop in a grocery store is to buy the smallest count in de-caf for guests.

Perhaps it would help to create an interface where a user could simply click on the floor to indicate where they want to go and use the mouse pointer to adjust one's view, similar to the controls in Google Street View. I had no trouble seeing the product I wanted, and similar items were placed near each other.  I am simply more familiar with it and the brand I like is located on a higher shelf in my usual store, making it more accessible. I knew Starbucks items would all be grouped together and I was previously familiar with the item's packaging. It was also located on a level that was easy to see; not too high, not too low.|1.0|1

It was easy to find what I was looking for because each brand was arranged by count size, different strengths and flavors.  As long as the items are easy to find, it really doesn't matter to me.

For Green Mountain Coffee, my favorite, it was quite easy to find the light and decaf.  I decided on the regular Maxwell house because it was a little less expensive and still a good quality brand.  So this was easy to find as well. Arranged by brands, and then it was easy to find the varieties you wanted.  The most common brands were the easiest to find/ on the right levels.  I was looking for lite coffee which can sometimes be harder to find, but was easy to find in the Green Mountain brand.  I'm used to my store, so I don't have any problems finding what I want.

The extreme CLUMSINESS of the  joystick  motion control system.  And, since I am not very familiar with the Original Donut Shop brand, I thought that the  Extra Bold  or  Extreme Bold  (I don't remember exactly how it looked) in the upper right hand corner of the package meant that the package that I finally selected wasn't actually the  Regular  flavor that I was supposed to be looking for!!!|3.0|3

I liked this arrangement so much, I'm going to visit my local Target to check out what's available. I loved the variety, and that the coffees were sorted. Seasonal flavors of a brand were together for instance. Because I have a large family that frequently visits me for the weekend, I like to keep everybody's favorites on hand, and to have an interesting variety for the adventurous. This arrangement reminded me I needed hot cocoa for the kids and hazelnut coffee for my daughter. I only bought three boxes out of habit, but if this aisle were really available to me, I'd do a big stock up shopping of variety of boxes.  My local target has an uninspiring arrangement of kcups. I usially wander down the aisle, but I've only purchased a box once. It should be placed closer to the Keurig products. Thats where I expected to find it.

If I see  artificially flavored  I typically ignore or other brands I've determined are lower quality. I don't really care how they're arranged.

5nxtdvepbvfe94uv|1. Shopping via the 3-D online shopping experience is nowhere near the similarity of an actual shopping experience. The joystick is clumsy, the survey takes too long, and most importantly, it makes the average person queasy. I'm sitting here now and could, quite frankly, blow chunks.     2. A little direction or information would be ever so fucking appreciated. During the pointless  trial period  (I say pointless because the virtual shopping experience has been done in surveys for at least the last 4 years...get with the program, it's nothing new and they're all the same!), there was no info stating that one would be expected to remain in only that aisle. Seeing as I spent half of my time aimlessly wandering back and forth waiting for the survey to progress, it would have been great to know that, particularly when you caption it with  explore the store . How about  explore the aisle  if I can only fucking explore that single aisle?!    3. Also during the trial period, if you wish that a person only picks up a particular item, then do them the enormous courtesy of telling them to only pick up that fucking item. Once again, your survey  that was apparently composed by someone with an IQ of 25 (oh wait, the IQ of the average Wal-Mart employee) states  explore the products, pick up products, add to shopping cart  would have been better served if you had informed the consumer to *only* pick up the Purina dog food seeing as that was the only item that worked. I know because I tried everything from the lightbulbs to cording to apple juice to cat litter that were also in that same aisle.     4. This leads me to another observation about the virtual shopping experience. It mimics Wal-Mart's complete disorganization. Do you realize in your shopping trial experience, you have dog food with cat litter with lightbulbs with apple juice with batteries (if I remember those correctly) with cording for renovation/construction products in the home. WTF?! I know it's not PC to use anymore, but I seriously felt like I was strolling through a store designed by a retard...oh wait, a severely mentally defected individual who had apparently no business, nor marketing experienced whatsoever. Please, Wal-Mart, do yourselves a favor and hire someone who graduated from business school that possesses BOTH the diploma and a brain.     5. When the actual shopping experience occurred, where were the pregnancy tests and ovulation kits the first time around?! They certainly weren't anywhere in the aisle, nor at the top of the shelf. I know, because I looked, because it's one of the few things that I purchase from Wal-Mart's feminine hygiene/sexual aid aisle.     6. This is simple biology, folks. If someone states that they are purchasing ovulation predictors and doesn't choose condoms as well, then the implication to be inferred is that they are *trying* to conceive, not prevent pregnancy. Again, I have to return to the IQ of 25 because I could not believe how many times this survey did this. Do Wal-Mart employees and executives not understand where babies come from and how they are made?!    7. As I inferred Wal-Mart's complete and utter lack of human anatomy and sexual reproduction based on this survey, it brings me no great surprise that I was asked if I was uncomfortable shopping for any of these items via the physical stores as opposed to online or at  discreet  locations. Lol...seriously?! I'm an adult. If an adult is uncomfortable shopping for these items, then perhaps they shouldn't be engaging in any type of sexual activity whatsoever as they clearly do not possess the maturity to handle a child, nor a sexually transmitted disease, if that were to occur.|99.0|3

uz8r17strt2vkwqb|I can't believe it took me so long to find the 6 oz product.  It was difficult to locate the specific product because the boxes are similarly colored and designed.  I spent a lot of time just going through the Mucinex products.    It is still difficult to smoothly move around, back and forth and up and down, but I  thoroughly enjoy this type of survey.|1.0|1

In the 3D store, I had to move the joystick so that I faced the front, move a little front, turn left, etc. It would be nice if there was an option like Goolge Maps where if you click the place you want to go to, you're taken at that position. Also, some of the words when I clicked on the item was pixelated so it was inconvenient to have to zoom in to read the descriptions.|1.0|1
