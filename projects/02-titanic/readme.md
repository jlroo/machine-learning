# Titanic Dataset Analysis

The challenge is to develop an algorithm using the Titanic dataset to make a prediction about passenger survival. The data set consist of a number of variables (features) describing each passenger (gender, age, ticket class, fare, others). There are two data sets the training set which contains a Survival variable and the test set to determine the accuracy of the predictive model on unseen data.
